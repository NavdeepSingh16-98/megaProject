regexr.com - email address validator

always trim in controller only
select:false - whenever you will make a database query, this will not come

but how we will get password
serach - mongoose enum

//crypto is a default node js library

// challenge - we want to encrypt password

search mongoose hooks
- pre hook
- do not use arrow function in schema because we have to refer the password field of userSchema using this.password

mongoose give us modified function to check if filed is mofified

mongoose schema methods - functionality in schema - similar to inject/make prototypes

secret and expiry time should come from .env therefore '-bad


to handle images we will use aws -

npm package - formidable

also refer - pro backend course- fileUpload section has explained in depth

****while working with aws always refer -

aws access key 
aws secret

also there is an option for region as well 


in portal - in probackend - see form upload and image upload



mongoose is limit to one point, then we have mongodb , especially we have mongodb aggregation pipeline
