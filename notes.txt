regexr.com - email address validator

always trim in controller only
select:false - whenever you will make a database query, this will not come

but how we will get password
serach - mongoose enum

//crypto is a default node js library

// challenge - we want to encrypt password

search mongoose hooks
- pre hook
- do not use arrow function in schema because we have to refer the password field of userSchema using this.password

mongoose give us modified function to check if filed is mofified
